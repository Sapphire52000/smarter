# Product Context: Smart Academy Management App

## Why This Project Exists  
The Smart Academy Management App was created to help academy owners and instructors automate repetitive administrative tasks such as class scheduling, attendance tracking, and tuition calculation.  
By analyzing messages between parents and teachers using AI, the system intelligently suggests updates to the timetable, tracks class sessions including carry-over lessons, and calculates tuition automatically — reducing manual workload and human error.

## Problems It Solves  
1. Schedule change requests via chat are scattered and hard to manage manually  
2. Manual attendance tracking and lesson counting often leads to mistakes  
3. Carry-over sessions and tuition calculations are complex and time-consuming  
4. Lack of a comprehensive view of operational data for academy managers  

## How It Works  
1. Instructors and managers log in via Firebase Authentication  
2. AI analyzes parent-teacher messages and suggests timetable changes  
3. Suggested changes are only applied after confirmation by the instructor or manager  
4. Attendance is recorded manually or automatically, and session counts are tracked  
5. Monthly summaries of sessions and tuition are displayed on a dashboard  

## User Experience Goals  
1. AI-powered suggestions for rapid timetable adjustments  
2. Clear dashboard view for managers showing session counts and fees  
3. Intuitive UI with role-based navigation (manager/instructor/parent)  
4. Monthly stats and carry-over tracking per student  
5. Mobile access for anytime, anywhere usage  

## Key User Journey  
1. Launch app → Log in (role-based home screen)  
2. Parent chats with instructor → AI analyzes message → Suggests change → Manager approves  
3. Attendance is tracked → Session count updated automatically  
4. Manager reviews monthly summary for billing  
5. Optional: Update settings or user account
