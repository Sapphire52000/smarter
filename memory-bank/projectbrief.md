# Project Summary: Smart Academy Management App

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered academy management app developed with Flutter and Firebase. It is designed for academy owners and instructors to manage class schedules, communicate with parents, and automate administrative tasks.

The core feature is an AI assistant that reads chat messages exchanged between instructors and parents and **suggests schedule updates**. These suggestions must be confirmed by the academy owner or instructor before being applied. Additionally, the app automatically calculates the number of classes taught, carried-over sessions from the previous month, and tuition fees dueâ€”providing real-time financial visibility to the academy administrator.

## Key Requirements
1. Firebase-based authentication with role distinction (admin/instructor/parent)  
2. Class schedule management with AI-powered suggestions  
3. AI chat analysis that recommends schedule updates based on parent-teacher conversations  
4. Confirmation prompt to instructor/admin before applying schedule changes  
5. Automatic calculation of class count, carried-over sessions, and current tuition  
6. Dashboard showing monthly attendance and fee status  
7. Monthly roll-over logic for unused class sessions
